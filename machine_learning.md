  - Provide a migration plan from <a> to <b> by providing a step-by-step approach to allow incremental migration.

Write a "production-ready" docstring for <target> using the Google style guide. The docstring includes:

1.  **Summary line**: A concise one-line description of what the function does
2.  **Extended description**: More detailed explanation of the function's behavior and logic
3.  **Args section**: Detailed description of each parameter with types and purposes
4.  **Returns section**: Description of the return value structure and contents
5.  **Raises section**: Documentation of the exception that can be raised
