## Resize a Text Box in Photoshop Without Scaling the Text

**Goal:** Change the size of the text *container* while keeping the font size unchanged.

---

### ✅ Use Paragraph Text (Not Point Text)

- **Paragraph Text** has a draggable bounding box.
- **Point Text** scales when transformed.

**Convert if needed:**
- Select the text layer → **Type → Convert to Paragraph Text**

---

### ✅ Resize the Text Box Correctly

1. Select the **Type Tool (T)**.
2. Click inside the text to reveal the bounding box.
3. Drag the bounding box handles to resize.
    - **Do NOT use** `Cmd/Ctrl+T` — that scales the text.
4. Text will reflow instead of resize.

---

### 🔧 Optional Tips

- Hold **Shift** when dragging top/bottom handles to keep width fixed.
- If text doesn’t reflow:  
  Check **Window → Paragraph** for alignment/wrapping/hyphenation settings.
